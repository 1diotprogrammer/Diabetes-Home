There is responsive design but we suggest use 375*812 for patient screen view. As we know mobile phone is more often used than PC.

You can't choose a date too fast in the calender. Heroku will get stuck. Darkmode is in the upper right corner of the patient home page.

Click patient home page to enter the detail interface

Click the client logo to return to the dashboard page

There is a prompt when the medal hover is 80%

The date output will change the language display according to the browser with different default language settings

If you didn't hand in the data on that day, the person who didn't hand in the data will be in the absence list

Patients and doctors have two entrances
